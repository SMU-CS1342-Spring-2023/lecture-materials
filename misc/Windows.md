# Windows Compiler / Clion Setup
For this course we will be using the CLion IDE by JetBrains to do most of our program development. This is an IDE that was specifically designed for C++ developers and provides a lot of helpful tools to make your programming experience better and more efficient. For Windows, this comes pre-packaged with MinGW which is a toolset that allows your computer to compile C++ programs! 

1. First, you need to sign up for a JetBrains student license. If you do not have one already, visit [https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) to acquire your free license. (Remember your password as you will need it later)
2. Once you have a Student License you may download CLion by visiting the downloads page [https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/). Then click **Download**
3. Once downloaded, double click the downloaded CLion setup file and walk through the steps to get setup. You may choose all the default settings. 
4. Next, you will activate your CLion / JetBrains account. To do so make sure `Get license from` has `JB Account` selected, then enter your username and password that you created when setting up your student license in step 1.
5. Click `Next` after your license has been verified
6. Finally, select the toolchain you want to use with CLion - for this course select `MinGW`.
7. Wait until the tool detection completes, then click `Start using CLion` to complete the setup. Thats it!
